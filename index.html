    <h1>Autism</h1>
    <p>Autism, also known as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a developmental condition that affects how a person communicates, learns, and interacts with others. People with autism may experience the world differently, and this can include differences in social skills, sensory sensitivity, and behavior. Autism is called a “spectrum” because it affects individuals in many different ways, and no two people with autism are the same. With understanding and support, people with autism can thrive and live fulfilling lives.</p>
